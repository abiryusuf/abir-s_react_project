        <p>
                I love solving problems and making other people laugh. My hobbies are reading, watching movies, and playing cricket. I've also recently picked up coding bootcamp at Columbia University and Programming Hero that have been super fun. It's refreshing to pick up something and feel like I'm making large steps up in quality and complexity. 
        
        I greatly enjoy pushing myself and the thrill of solving problems is intoxicating. 
        
        Group work is one of my favorite things. Having someone to bounce ideas off of is extremely helpful. Being flexible on work is also very nice, solving problems as they show up is also something that I enjoy.
